> A simple experiment with ray casting and C.

## 🤔 About the project

This project is a simple experiment with ray casting and C. It's not really a game, but rather a proof of concept. You
can walk around and observe the environment, which consists of walls and an open sky.

I previously made something similar in Python, but it was quite slow (~100 fps), so I wanted to see how fast it could be
in C (it's ~2000 fps). I also really like C and ray casting, so it's a fun project indeed.

## 💻 Built with

- C99
- CMake
- SDL2
- OpenMP

> ⚠️ This project currently requires Clang

> 💡 On Debian-based systems, you can install all necessary dependencies with:

```shell
sudo apt-get install -y clang cmake libsdl2-dev libsdl2-gfx-dev libsdl2-image-dev libomp-dev
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/reznakt/ray-casting.git && cd ray-casting
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

## 🎮 How to Play

Currently, there are no game features per se. You can walk around and observe the environment. However, you can
configure various parameters by modifying the header files:

- Screen size
- Field of view
- Number of rays
- Keymappings
